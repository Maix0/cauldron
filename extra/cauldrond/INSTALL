Installation
============
Edit CMakeLists.txt and change the UID, GID and PIDFILE options according to
your needs. Leave everything else unchanged.

The amount of clients this websocket server can handle defines how many
simultaneous players your Cauldron VTT website can have. The default is 32. To
change this, change the MAX_CLIENTS value in src/ws.h.

Run the script 'compile' to compile this websocket server. It requires CMake to
compile. Copy the created cauldrond binary to /usr/sbin.

Copy conf/cauldrond to /etc/init.d and use '/etc/init.d/cauldron start' to start
the Cauldron VTT websocket server.


1) Hiawatha web server
----------------------
If you use the Hiawatha web server, you can use the following configuration line:

  WebSocket = ws://127.0.0.1:2001 /websocket 30

In the Cauldron VTT web application directory, edit settings/cauldron.conf and
set WEBSOCKET_PORT to 443.


2) Other web server
-------------------
If you use any other web server, you have two options:
- use the XInetd & STunnel4 solution, or
- try to make the websocket work through your web server.


2a) XInetd & STunnel4
---------------------
This websocket server doesn't speak TLS. This setup uses STunnel4 for the TLS
offloading xinetd to start the websocket server when a client connects.

In the Cauldron VTT web application directory, edit settings/cauldron.conf and
set WEBSOCKET_PORT to 2000.

In this setup, cauldrond will listen to port 2001 and xinetd to 2000. If you
want to change that, change the port settings in the files CMakeLists.txt and
in the configuration files in the directory 'conf'. Also, make changes in the
file settings/cauldron.conf, located in the Cauldron VTT web application
directory.

2b) Websocket through web server
--------------------------------
You need to forward websocket requests (they all start with the /websocket path)
to the websocket daemon which runs at port 2001 by default. Make sure your web
server does the TLS offloading. In the Cauldron VTT web application directory,
edit settings/cauldron.conf and set WEBSOCKET_PORT to 443.
